Faisdodo release
================

The fleurdelas class is an IDL implementation of a LAS file reader/writer. The class object can read, write and manipulate points and/or full waveforms contained in the binary LAS file format.
It can handle any LAS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 with point format from 0 to 10.

The project has now a brand new and comprehensive wiki. You will find basic and advance usage of fleurdelas class object.

We also have a user group that you can found at [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fleur-de-las]

=========
IMPORTANT
=========

Fleurdelas needs the Sazerac library in order to works properly, so please don't forget to also clone our Sazerac repository

=========

Please let us know if you want or need more features implemented. Also report any bugs or issues at info at carbomap dot com.

As it is an open project, we would like to see you involved, so please don't hesitate to clone and/or fork this project.

If you’re wondering about the name of the release; it celebrates a Cajun dance party  :: the Faisdodo.
